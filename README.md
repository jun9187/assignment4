## Reflection
Through this talk, I gain some insights from I-FARM which was introduced in this talk about how emerging technology can aid in agriculture and commercial activities. I-FARM is able to reduce food wastage, simplify process of buying groceries and also provide fresh vegetables to consumers. From this example, I found that new technology can aid human life in various aspects such as industry, business and also daily-lifeÂ activities.
